# Documentation Refactor Summary

**Date**: 2025-01  
**Scope**: Complete documentation restructure for clarity and consistency

## Issues Addressed

### Critical Errors Fixed

1. **Wrong CLI command**: USER_HANDBOOK.md showed `iacsec scan` → corrected to `iacsec`
2. **IACSEC_MODEL_CACHE over-emphasis**: Moved from required to optional/advanced sections
3. **Duplicate content**: Removed redundant installation instructions, CLI options, examples across files
4. **Unclear focus**: Each document now has a single, clear purpose

### Consistency Improvements

- Unified command examples (removed inconsistent syntax)
- Standardized terminology (post-filter vs postfilter → post-filter)
- Consistent code block formatting
- Clarified when IACSEC_MODEL_CACHE is useful (CI/CD, space constraints)

## New Structure

### README.md (128 lines)
**Purpose**: Quick start for end users

**Contents**:
- Project overview (what/why)
- 3-step quick start
- Basic usage examples
- Common CLI options
- Troubleshooting essentials
- Links to detailed docs

**Target audience**: New users who want to get running in 5 minutes

---

### docs/USER_HANDBOOK.md (521 lines)
**Purpose**: Complete operational guide

**Contents**:
- Detailed installation (venv, PyTorch variants, model fetching)
- All CLI options with examples
- Output format explanations (SARIF, JSONL, CSV)
- Advanced features (custom cache, threshold tuning)
- Comprehensive troubleshooting
- CI/CD integration recipes (GitHub Actions, GitLab, Jenkins)
- Best practices and verification checklist

**Target audience**: Operators deploying iacsec in production

---

### docs/ROADMAP.md (174 lines)
**Purpose**: Research background and vision

**Contents**:
- Problem statement
- Research stages 1-3 (exploration, training, evaluation)
- Key findings (encoders > generative models)
- Why we built a tool
- Future directions (short/medium/long term)
- Open questions and lessons learned

**Target audience**: Researchers, academics, and stakeholders understanding the science

**Changes**: Removed all implementation details (now in DEVELOPMENT_REPORT.md)

---

### docs/DEVELOPMENT_REPORT.md (490 lines)
**Purpose**: Architecture and contributor guide

**Contents**:
- High-level architecture diagram
- Module responsibilities with extension points
- Design decisions with rationales
- Extension guide (adding rules, exporters, models, technologies)
- Testing strategy (unit, e2e, CI)
- Performance considerations
- Code style and maintenance checklist

**Target audience**: Developers and contributors modifying the codebase

**Changes**: Removed user-facing content (now in USER_HANDBOOK.md)

---

### docs/SCHEMA.md (303 lines)
**Purpose**: Technical data model reference

**Contents**:
- Detection type definition and examples
- Prediction type definition and examples
- JSONL joined format
- SARIF/CSV mapping tables
- Validation rules
- Extension examples

**Target audience**: Developers integrating with iacsec or extending the schema

**Changes**: Removed narrative explanations, kept pure technical reference

---

## Key Improvements

### For End Users

- **Faster onboarding**: README.md gets users scanning in 3 commands
- **Better troubleshooting**: USER_HANDBOOK.md has comprehensive error scenarios with fixes
- **CI/CD clarity**: Complete integration examples for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins

### For Developers

- **Clear architecture**: DEVELOPMENT_REPORT.md explains module boundaries and data flow
- **Extension guidance**: Step-by-step instructions for adding rules, exporters, models
- **Testing strategy**: Explicit coverage goals and golden update procedures

### For Researchers

- **Research narrative**: ROADMAP.md tells the complete story from problem to solution
- **Reproducibility**: References to frozen thresholds, SHA-verified weights, deterministic outputs
- **Future directions**: Clear roadmap for next steps

## Verification

All documentation changes are **non-breaking**:

✅ CLI works unchanged: `iacsec --help` succeeds  
✅ No code modifications (docs only)  
✅ Command examples verified against actual CLI  
✅ Technical details match implementation  

## Migration Guide

**For existing users**: No changes needed. Documentation now reflects actual usage patterns.

**For contributors**: Read DEVELOPMENT_REPORT.md before making changes. Extension guides are now comprehensive.

**For researchers**: ROADMAP.md provides full context without implementation noise.

## Files Changed

- ✏️ `README.md` - Complete rewrite (focus on quick start)
- ✏️ `docs/USER_HANDBOOK.md` - Complete rewrite (comprehensive operations)
- ✏️ `docs/ROADMAP.md` - Restructured (research only)
- ✏️ `docs/DEVELOPMENT_REPORT.md` - Restructured (architecture only)
- ✏️ `docs/SCHEMA.md` - Cleaned (technical reference only)

## Next Steps

- [ ] Update CONTRIBUTING.md to reference DEVELOPMENT_REPORT.md
- [ ] Create video walkthrough using README.md quick start
- [ ] Generate API documentation from docstrings (future)
- [ ] Translate documentation for international audiences (future)
